# Difference-in-Differences Analysis of 1930 Bank Policy Intervention

This project investigates the impact of a policy intervention introduced in **November 1930** on the number of banks that remained open in **District 6** and **District 8**.

Using a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach, the analysis compares the number of operational banks **before and after the policy** between the two districts to estimate the causal effect of the intervention.

## Objectives
- Assess the effectiveness of the policy using a natural experiment setup
- Validate the parallel trends assumption prior to treatment
- Estimate DiD treatment effects using R

## Status
- ðŸ“Š Data loading
- ðŸ“ˆ DiD modeling
- âœ… Result interpretation and visualization
