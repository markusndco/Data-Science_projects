# Causal Analysis of Police Interventions in Domestic Violence: An Instrumental Variable Approach

This project uses the Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment (MDVE) dataset to evaluate the causal impact of different police interventionsâ€”such as arrest, separation, and adviceâ€”on the likelihood of repeat domestic violence incidents. The analysis is grounded in causal inference theory and applies the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) regression method using an instrumental variable framework.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To determine whether randomized police interventions reduce the likelihood of repeat domestic violence incidents, and to estimate the causal impact of intervention types on reporting behavior.

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset

**Source**: MDVE (Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment)  
**Variables of Interest**:
- `T_RANDOM`: Random assignment of police response (Instrument)
- `T_FINAL`: Final police action taken (Treatment)
- `P_REPORT`: Whether the incident was reported (Outcome)
- Demographics: Victim/Suspect race, chemical use, weapons, relationship type, incident reason

---

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded the dataset in R and cleaned variables
- Addressed missing values and removed irrelevant features
- Conducted exploratory correlation analysis and plotted distributions

### 2. Instrument Selection
- Chose `T_RANDOM` as the **instrumental variable** for `T_FINAL`
- Justification: `T_RANDOM` is exogenous and influences police response but not the outcome (reporting) directly

### 3. Descriptive Analysis
- Frequency tables and cross-tabs for repeat incidents (`T_FINAL`)
- Race-based comparisons across suspect/victim categories
- Time series plot of incident frequency by intervention group

### 4. Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) Regression
Used the `ivreg()` function to perform IV regression:

```r
model_2sls <- ivreg(
  P_REPORT ~ T_FINAL + V_RACE + S_RACE + V_CHEM + S_CHEM +
  S_DMNOR1 + S_DMNOR2 + WEAPON + GUNS + REASON1 + REASON2 +
  REASON3 + REASON4 + R_RELATE |
  T_RANDOM + V_RACE + S_RACE + V_CHEM + S_CHEM + S_DMNOR1 +
  S_DMNOR2 + WEAPON + GUNS + REASON1 + REASON2 + REASON3 +
  REASON4 + R_RELATE,
  data = data
)
