# 🧠 Data Science Projects

A collection of real-world data science case studies using **statistical modeling** and **causal inference** techniques. These projects solve high-impact problems across domains like **healthcare**, **economics**, and **public policy** using methods such as:

- Logistic Regression
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)
- Causal Analysis
- Time Series Forecasting

Each folder contains complete R scripts, supporting documentation, and data to ensure **end-to-end reproducibility**.
